# r3m4ind3r
This is a simple python cum bash script that I wrote while starting my GATE preparation.
Data.csv contains topics to be covered on a daily basis.

Change the paths of the data.csv in code.py and cody.py in script.sh before executing.

Execute script.sh for output.

To get the remainders on opening terminal, add the following to bashrc and replace the path with your path

source /home/sunny/r3m4ind3r/script.sh
